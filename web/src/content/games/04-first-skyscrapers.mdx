Oooh! You reached **Avenue des FAR**! you are going places!

At the start of the 20th century, Casablanca experienced rapid growth, drawing people from all over the world, particularly architects and real estate investors.

In 1936, two cousins, real estate investors Moretti and Millone, teamed up with French architect Pierre Jabin to construct one of Casablanca's first skyscrapers (by the time standards), also one of the tallest and largest residential buildings in North Africa at the time.

Standing 12 stories high, the building was innovative in how it catered to different types of residents. The lower floors housed spacious family apartments, while the top floor featured smaller studio units designed for single occupants.

Before continuing straight towards Mohammed V street, let's take a quick detour to visit the iconic clock tower, one of the earliest buildings constructed by the French Protectorate.

The clock tower was first built in 1909, then rebuilt in 1993 after its demolition in 1948.
