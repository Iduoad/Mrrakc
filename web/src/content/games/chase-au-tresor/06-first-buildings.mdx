Wow! you are getting good at this!

The real estate boom attracted influential figures from Morocco and from around the world, including Pacha Tazi and Pacha Thami El Glaoui, Moretti&Milone, and Bendahan...

This surge in investment triggered a domino effect, drawing even more investors and institutions from Europe, particularly France. 

Notably, major banks such as the British West African Bank and Crédit Lyonnais, as well as automobile manufacturers like Fiat and Citroën, established a presence in the city.

## Go! Go! 

Head down Rue Amraoui Brahim until you reach Mohammed V Street. Turn right, then take a left onto Rue Aristide Briand. 

On this street, you will discover the Bendahan Building, one of the city center's most elegant structures. Directly across from it stands the former British West African Bank; now converted into a Moroccan bank office, this historic building features a stunning facade reminiscent of a Greek temple. 

You will also find a shuttered, vintage travel agency along this same lane.
