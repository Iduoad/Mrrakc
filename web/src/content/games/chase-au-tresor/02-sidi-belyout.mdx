Correct! The animal associated with Sidi Belyout is indeed the **Lion**. 

Sidi Belyout, originally known as **Abu Hafs Omar bin Haroun Al-Madyouni**, is the legendary patron saint of Casablanca.

He was known for his mysterious origins and miraculous connection with lions, which earned him the title "Abu Louyouth" (Father of Lions).

According to local tales, he lived in seclusion in the wilderness of Ain Sbaa, where lions would peacefully gather around him, and his fountain's water was believed to ensure a return to Casablanca for anyone who drank from it.

Dead in the 14th century, his current shrine was built in 1851, and remains a historical and spiritual landmark in the city, reflecting the deep-rooted traditions and folklore of Casablanca.

Advance a little bit into **Bd Félix Houphouët-Boigny** and enjoy the beautiful palm trees.

I emphasize on appreciating the palm tree since some of them are more than 100 years old. Just around the street there is one of the oldest hotels of casablanca.

Look for it!
