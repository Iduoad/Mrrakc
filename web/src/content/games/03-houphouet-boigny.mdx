Nice one! You found Hotel Plaza!

Hotel Plaza is one of the oldest hotels in Casablanca outside of the walls. It is situated in Félix Houphouët-Boigny street.

Félix Houphouët-Boigny street was one of the first streets of the new city, it was opened by the French protectorate to connect the Port with the city.

Its foundation was controvertial since the French created an openning in the city wall and moved a the Sidi Belyout Muslim cemetry. This insited many pretest all across the city.

If you're wondering why Casablanca's city walls are not closed on the northern side, this is the reason. You can still spot parts of the original wall behind the Sidi Belyout mausoleum.

## Go! Go!
