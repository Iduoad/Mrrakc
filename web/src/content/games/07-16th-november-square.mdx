Nice Job! Did you use google for that?

"Casablanca is home to many popular public squares, the most famous being United Nations Square. 

For first-time visitors, this is often the initial point of contact with the city, offering a perfect glimpse into the chaotic yet beautiful energy that defines Casablanca. 

Another notable location is the smaller November 16th Square, which is ringed by stunning Art Deco structures such as the Tazi Building, La Chope, and the British West African Bank. 

This square is also distinguished by a red sculpture-fountain known as 'Source of Life' (Source de vie). Created in 1982 by artist Abdelhaq Sijelmassi, this landmark underwent a complete restoration in 2021 during the Covid-19 pandemic.
