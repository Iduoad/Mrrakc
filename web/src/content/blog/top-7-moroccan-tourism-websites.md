When I first started traveling around the country, I thought there wasn't much useful information about tourism in Morocco. But over the years, I changed my mind and now believe that the officials and the tourism community in Morocco are actually doing a good job sharing information about different places to visit in Morocco.

In this post, I'll share my top 7 places to find travel info about Morocco. Some of them inspired me to start the Mrrakc community.

## 1. The main portal
If you're new to Morocco or want a quick overview of the country, start by checking out the official website of Morocco's National Tourism Office (ONMT). It's the best place to learn about the country before your visit. They provide info about tourist spots all over Morocco and helpful tips for planning your trip.

## 2. Marrakech: The Mecca of Moroccan tourism
When it comes to tourism in Morocco, Marrakech stands out as one of the top choices for travelers. The ONMT has created a dedicated website solely for Marrakech, providing a comprehensive resource about the city. This website offers all the essential details about what to explore and where to go in the city. One of the most interesting features you should look into, is the updated calendar of events taking place in Marrakech.

## 3. Museums
Exploring museums is something I love doing whenever I'm in a new city. If you share this interest, the National Foundation of Museums (FNM) has us taken care of. On their official website, you can discover a list of all the national museums along with essential details like their locations, ticket prices, and operating hours.

## 4. Documentation award goes to
The majority of the organisms we've encountered up to now utilize their websites to present all their information. L'Oriental Agency, on the other hand, has undertaken an extensive effort by producing numerous books and magazines about L'Oriental region. These publications are available in both French and English, showcasing the abundant natural and cultural heritage of the Region.

## 5. The national parks you maybe don't know about
Morocco has 10 National parks, distributed all over the country. These parks are home to many unique plants and animals, with some carrying significant cultural and natural value for both Morocco and the global community. The Moroccan Agency for Ecotourism and preservation of Nature ([AMEPN](https://amepn.ma/reseau-des-parcs/)) has dedicated web pages for each of these parks on their official website. Along with AMEPN, Information Exchange Center for Biodiversity in Morocco ([CHMCBD](https://ma.chm-cbd.net/biodiversity/faun_flor) offers a valuable resource for delving into the world of these national parks and the captivating ecosystems they house.

> You may find the UX of both websites very lacking but they hold a good amount of useful information about Moroccan Parks and Nature in general.

Another great initiative when is comes to National parks, is M'Goun National Park website which displays the rich Geological patrimony of M'Goun Geopark - The first Geopark in MENA region.

## 6. The best hobbiest!
Jacques GANDINI is one of the best non Moroccan explorers of Morocco. He worked on many awesome projects about travel in Morocco, including his 4x4 travel guides published in [extreme-sud](https://www.extrem-sud.com/), his works on the [history of Ouarzazate](https://www.ouarzazate-1928-1956.fr/) and my personal favorite: [Prehistoire du Maroc](https://www.prehistoire-du-maroc.com/) A collection of archaeological sites that emphasizes the importance of Morocco in prehistoric times.

## 7. The best for last
Nearly every one of Morocco's 12 regions has a dedicated portal aimed at showcasing their tourist attractions and natural resources to visitors. However, Souss Massa is taking the lead with their outstanding efforts. The "Explore Souss Massa" website provides a comprehensive resource containing all the essential information about the region's cities, recommended destinations, activities, and much more.
