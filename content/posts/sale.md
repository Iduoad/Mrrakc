> You know Rabat? I live in the city on the other side of the river.

Whenever I met new friends from all over the world, I find myself repeating this sentence. The reason whym I've made the decision to guide you through the streets of Sale's Medina and tell you the tales each corner has to tell.

## The lost history
Sale is undeniably one of the oldest cities in Morocco, boasting a rich historical legacy. Situated alongside Chellah (Sala Colonia) across the Bouregreg River, Sale held great significance as a vital port for both the Phoenicians and the subsequent Roman occupants.

Throughout its existence, the city has experienced a cycle of construction, destruction, and subsequent rebuilding, making it challenging to uncover concrete evidence of its pre-Islamic past. Nonetheless, historical accounts affirm Sale's importance as a prominent Atlantic port that attracted various civilizations, including the Romans and later the Umayyads. ## The inception ~ 10th century

The origins of modern-day Sale trace back to the era of Tamim ibn Ziri's (From Banu Ifran) rule over the Kingdom of Chellah, attributed to the establishment of its foundations. However, it is widely acknowledged that the rise of Sale, as we know it today, is primarily associated with the arrival of the Banu Achra's Family from Andalusia. They settled on the western bank of the Bouregreg River, near the city's grand mosque [1], which was initially initiated by Tamim ibn Ziri. This marked the beginnings of the Tala'a neighborhood (Jemaa neighborhood)[2], which served as a focal point for their settlement. Over time, Sale expanded with the emergence of additional neighborhoods such as Zenata[3], L'Blida[4], and Laalou[5].

Presently, these neighborhoods continue to exist, with generations of Slaoui residents constructing, inheriting, and nurturing their houses throughout the centuries. Even today, as you wander through the alleys of the Medina, you can sense the enduring legacy and captivating allure of these architectural wonders.

Adding to all of that, two members of the founding Abou Achara family (Sidi Abdellah and Sidi Kacem) are laid to rest within the Medina itself, and their mausoleums continue to be lovingly maintained by one of their descendants.

## The Rise

During the reign of the Almoravid and Almohad dynasties, Sale reached its pinnacle of importance in history.

After the Almoravids conquered the city, it experienced significant expansion with reinforced walls, the construction of new mosques, and overall improvements to its infrastructure.

When the Almohads emerged victorious over the Almoravids in Marrakech, they faced challenges in persuading Sale to join their new rule. After fierce battles, they finally entered the city, demolishing the south-eastern walls and gates.

Despite these upheavals, Sale continued to maintain its paramount importance, solidifying its position as one of the region's most critical cities, second only to the capital, Marrakech. It played a pivotal role as a strategic hub for Jihad, where troops diligently prepared themselves before embarking on campaigns to the north in Andalusia or east to Ifriquia (present-day Tunisia and Libya). The significance of these events led to the birth of a new city, which would serve this purpose - Rabat or Erribat, meaning "fortification".

Indeed, while Sale flourished during the Almoravid dynasty, it truly reached its peak during the Almohad reign, particularly under the rule of Abu Yusuf Yaaqub Al-Mansour.

During the reign of Yaaqub Al-Mansour, the construction of the iconic Great Mosque of Sale (Second largest Mosque in the Maghreb to AlKoutoubia) marked a significant milestone in the city's architectural history. This magnificent mosque not only served as a place of worship but also included a school and an innovative space for ablution (Wudu') that was ahead of its time. The mosque stood as a testament to Sale's architectural grandeur and the visionary approach of Al-Mansour.

Furthermore, Al-Mansour's visionary initiatives extended to the improvement of the city's water system. By tapping into the abundant water sources from the nearby Maamoura forest, he enhanced the city's access to clean water, providing a vital resource for its residents.

These advancements and the city's growing reputation attracted scholars and wise men from various parts of the world, infusing Sale with a newfound scientific dimension and fostering an environment of intellectual exchange and innovation.

## The Golden ages

After the Almohad dynasty fell, Sale experienced a period of turmoil. Power struggles among the Marinid rulers had a significant impact on the city. The chaotic situation came to a head when the Spanish launched an attack during Eid, causing significant damage. This marked the first time a foreign force had attacked a Moroccan city since the Almohad era.

In response, Abu Yusuf Yaaqub Ibn Abdelhak, the Sultan in Fez, organized an army and besieged Sale until the Spanish forces surrendered. Once liberated, Abu Yusuf Yaaqub took measures to strengthen the city's defenses. He rebuilt the southern and western walls, enhancing the military infrastructure. Additionally, he commissioned to a well-known Andalusian Engineer Mohammed Ben Al-Haj Al-Ishbili the construction of a warship factory on the Bouregreg coast in the southwestern part of the city, which was accessible through the gates of Bab Lamrissa and Bab Dar Sinaa.

Furthermore, Abu Yusuf Yaaqub constructed the western wall of Sale, including a significant bastion known as Borj Adoumoue, meaning the "Bastion of Tears." This name derived from the Sultan's personal involvement in the construction, during which he was moved to tears by the tragic events that had befallen Sale.

During the Marinid era, Sale experienced its heyday, particularly under the rule of two prominent Sultans, Abu Al Hassan Ibn Othmane and Abu Inan Faris, who bestowed special attention upon the city. Abu Al Hassan, during his reign, oversaw the construction of a remarkable school near the grand mosque, believed by some to have been built upon the ruins of the famous Bani Achra Palace. Furthermore, he extended the Lakouas Walls, stretching over 14 kilometers, which served the purpose of transporting water from Maamoura to the city center.

Continuing the legacy of his father, Abu Inan Faris undertook significant projects as well. He established a Maristan, known as the "Strange School," which served as both a hospital for the sick and a school of medicine. The Maristan attracted the best doctors in the city, further enhancing the healthcare system. Additionally, Abu Inan Faris constructed Zaouiat Annoussak outside the city, providing accommodation for visitors and travelers passing through Sale.

Under the reign of these two Sultans, the city experienced a cultural and scientific renaissance, becoming a hub of knowledge. Scholars and scientists from across Morocco and beyond visited and resided in Sale, contributing to its intellectual and scientific achievements.

During the prosperous Marinid era, a prominent figure was Ahmed Ben Acher, a renowned theologian and Sufi. Originally from Andalusia, he relocated to Sale after the passing of his teacher Abdellah El Yabouri in Chellah. Even today, Sidi Ben Acher holds great significance for the people of Sale, and many continue to visit his mausoleum seeking blessings (Baraka).

## The City Walls and Fortifications

The Medina of Sale boasts one of the oldest walls in Morocco, dating back to the Almoravid era, and possibly even earlier.

When Sultan Yusuf Ibn Tachfin arrived in Sale, he initiated the construction of the city walls.

However, over a century later, during the Almohad Caliph Abd al-Mu'min Ibn Ali al-Kumi's conquest of Sale, the walls were destroyed after facing significant resistance. Later, Yaakub Al-Mansour, Abd al-Mu'min's grandson, reconstructed the Eastern and Northern walls, which are now known as the Almoravid walls.

Subsequently, following a Castilian attack on Sale, Sultan Abu Yusuf Yaakub of the Marinid dynasty completed the city's defenses by building the Southern and Western sections of the wall.

Following is the list of 7 most known gates of Sale:
- Almoravid walls:
    - Bab Lakhmiss: Previously known as Bab Fes as it served as the entrance for people heading to Fez. The name was changed when Souk Lakhmiss (Thursday Market) began taking place in front of the gate.
    - Bab Sebta: Located on the northern wall, this gate acquired its name because it was used by people starting their journeys to Sebta (Ceuta).
    - Bab Chaafa: Situated at the westernmost point of the northern walls.

- Marinid walls:
    - Bab Maalqa: A small gate found in the southern part of the city. There are various stories regarding its name, but the most widely accepted explanation is that it was used as the starting point for trips to Malaga in Andalusia.
    - Bab Jdid: Bab Jdid is a comparatively more recent gate that was constructed and opened during the rule of Moulay Abderahman Ibn Hisham (1822-1859). This gate primarily functioned as a storage area during the previous century.
    - Bab Dar Sinaâ: This gate obtained its name due to its function as an arsenal and weapons factory for pirates.
    - Bab Lamrissa: One of the largest gates in Morocco, this gate was situated near the lands that were flooded by the waters of Bouregreg. Consequently, ships would dock in front of it, earning it the name Bab al-Merissa, meaning "the harbor gate."

In addition to the City wall features 5 Bastions and 2 Saqalas:

- Borj Mthemen (Almohad)
- Borj Eddoumoue (Marinid)
- Borj El-Mellah (Marinid)
- Borj Erroukni (Alaouite)
- Borj Bab Sebta (Alaouite)
- Old Saqala (Alaouite)
- New Saqala (Alaouite)

Throughout various periods, these fortifications and bastions have played a significant role in safeguarding and protecting the city's strategic location against foreign invasions.
