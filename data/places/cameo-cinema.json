    "description": "Cameo Cinema (Cinéma Caméo) is a historical movie theater in Casablanca, typical of the mid-20th-century entertainment venues that proliferated during the city's rapid expansion. Like many classic single-screen cinemas, it has likely faced closure or conversion due to the rise of multiplexes and modern entertainment centers. If currently active, it serves as a local cinema house; if closed, it represents a significant piece of Casablanca's cinematic architectural heritage.",
