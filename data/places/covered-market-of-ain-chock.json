    "description": "The Covered Market of Ain Chock (Marché Couvert d'Aïn Chock) is a central marketplace serving the Aïn Chock neighborhood. Covered markets in Morocco are essential for daily life, providing local residents with fresh produce, meat, fish, and household goods in a more organized, enclosed environment than an open-air souk. It is a bustling center of local commerce and a sensory experience that reflects the neighborhood's daily rhythm.",
