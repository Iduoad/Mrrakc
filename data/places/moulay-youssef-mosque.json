    "description": "The Moulay Youssef Mosque (Mosquée Moulay Youssef) is a prominent religious building located in the planned Habous Quarter (Nouvelle Médina). It was designed by the French architectural duo **Auguste Cadet and Edmond Brion** and completed in 1923. The mosque is named after **Sultan Moulay Youssef**, who reigned during the early Protectorate. Its architecture is a key example of the French-designed Neo-Moorish style, featuring traditional materials and craftsmanship applied to a modern, orderly layout. It remains an active place of worship and a central feature of the Habous Quarter.",
