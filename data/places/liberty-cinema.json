    "description": "Liberty Cinema (Cinéma Liberté) is a former major movie theater completed in 1954, designed by architect **Albert Planque**. Like many cinemas of the mid-20th century, its architecture reflected the clean lines and functionalism of the Modernist style. The building is historically significant, but the cinema operations have ceased, and the structure has been **repurposed into a commercial space (Marjane Market)**. Its architectural heritage was formally acknowledged by its designation as a **National Material Patrimony** site in 2014.",
