    "description": "The Great Mosque of Casablanca (Jamaa El Kebir), also known as the **Makhzen Mosque** (Mosque of the Royal Administration), is one of the oldest mosques in the city. It was built around the **1780s CE** during the reign of Sultan **Sidi Mohammed Ibn Abdellah**, the founder of modern Casablanca (then Dār al-Bayḍāʼ). Its structure reflects the traditional Islamic architecture of the time, often featuring simple, dignified forms. It has undergone several renovations, notably by Sultan Moulay Hassan I and King Mohammed V, the latter rebuilding the minaret in the 1960s, inspired by the Koutoubia minaret in Marrakech, after it was destroyed in the 1907 French bombardment.",
