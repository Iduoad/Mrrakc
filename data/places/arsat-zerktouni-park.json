    "description": "Arsat Zerktouni Park, originally established around 1908-1910 under the name 'Jardin Public,' is a historic green space of approximately 2 hectares located near the Old Medina (Ancienne Médina) and the port. The term 'arsat' in Arabic traditionally refers to a garden with a vegetable patch and fruit trees, reflecting its initial design or use. The park was laid out between the port and the residential area, serving as a vital early green lung for the rapidly developing city of Casablanca. It remains an emblematic part of the medina's history and urban planning, showcasing early colonial-era green space design.",
