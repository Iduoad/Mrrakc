    "description": "The August 20th Hospital (Hôpital 20 Août 1953) is a major public medical facility in Casablanca with significant historical roots. It was originally built in the 1930s as a French military hospital named **Hôpital Jean Vial**. Following Morocco's independence, the hospital was renamed in 1956 to commemorate the **Revolution of the King and the People (August 20, 1953)**, a key date in the Moroccan struggle for independence when King Mohammed V was exiled. In 1976, it was integrated into the CHU Ibn Rochd (Casablanca University Hospital Center). The building's historical and architectural value was formally recognized when it was declared a **National Material Patrimony** site in 2004.",
