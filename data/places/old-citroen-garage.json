    "description": "The Old Citroen Garage Building is a remarkable piece of historical industrial architecture, completed in 1928 and designed by architect **Maurice-Jacques Ravazé**. It is significant for its early use of modernist and Art Deco principles in a large commercial-industrial structure, featuring open space and functionality essential for early automotive sales and service. The building's architectural legacy was acknowledged when it was declared a **National Material Patrimony** site in 2015. It is no longer a functioning garage but remains a historically important building.",
