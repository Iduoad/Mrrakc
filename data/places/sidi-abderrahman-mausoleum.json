It is built on a **rocky islet** just off the Corniche, accessible by foot during low tide via a narrow causeway. The shrine honors a local saint, Sidi Abderrahman, attracting pilgrims who seek blessings and spiritual healing. Its unique location makes it both a religious site and a picturesque landmark.",
