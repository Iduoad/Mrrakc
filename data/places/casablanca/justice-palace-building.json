    "description": "The Justice Palace (Palais de Justice) is a monumental governmental building in Casablanca, designed by architect **Joseph Marrast** and constructed between 1920 and 1923. It is a prime example of the grand Neo-Moorish architectural style, which aimed to establish a sense of modern authority while respecting Moroccan traditions. The building is characterized by its large central courtyard and meticulously crafted traditional ornamentation. It continues to function as a **Tribunal** (Courthouse) and was declared a **National Material Patrimony** site in 2003.",
