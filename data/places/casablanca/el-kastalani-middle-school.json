Its building, likely dating from the mid-20th century or the later Protectorate era, is deemed significant enough for its architectural or social history to be included in the national registry. It continues to function as a public school, providing middle-level education to the surrounding residential community. Its designation as a **National Material Patrimony** site in 2018 highlights its enduring value.",
