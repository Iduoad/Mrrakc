    "description": "The Bank Al Maghrib Building in Casablanca, the former branch of Morocco's central bank, is a monumental piece of colonial-era architecture. Designed by **Edmond Brion** and completed in 1937, it is situated prominently in the heart of the city's financial district. The building features a grand, imposing facade typical of central banks, often incorporating classical or Neo-Moorish architectural elements to symbolize stability and authority. Its historical significance and architectural quality earned it the status of a **National Material Patrimony** site in 2003.",
