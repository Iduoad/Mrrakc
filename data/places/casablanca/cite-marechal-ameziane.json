This 'cité' (housing estate) is a significant example of post-war housing projects during the French Protectorate, aiming to address the city's housing shortage. It is characterized by modernist architectural principles applied to social housing, and remains an active residential area today. The name commemorates Maréchal Jean-Louis Améziane, a notable figure from the French colonial administration.",
