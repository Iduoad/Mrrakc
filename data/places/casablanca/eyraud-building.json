    "description": "The Eyraud Building is a historical residential and commercial building located in the central Art Deco district of Casablanca. Designed by architect **George-Jean Grel** and completed in 1930, it embodies the modernist and Art Deco aesthetics of the period. Like other buildings in the area, it features a functional design that combines commerce on the lower floors with multi-story residential units above, reflecting the dense urban development fostered during the French Protectorate. It remains an actively inhabited building today.",
