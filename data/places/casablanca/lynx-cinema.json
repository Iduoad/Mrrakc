The cinema's design reflects the sleek, functional **Modernist** style of the post-war era, characteristic of major commercial architecture in Casablanca at the time. It played a role in the city's mid-century cultural life but is now **closed**, standing as an example of the city's declining single-screen cinema heritage.",
