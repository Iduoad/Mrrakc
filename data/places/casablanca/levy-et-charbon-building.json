It was designed by architects **Ignacio Sansone and Paul Busuttil**, who contributed to the city's rich Art Deco and Mediterranean-influenced architectural landscape. The building's design is typical of the multi-story apartment and retail blocks constructed in Casablanca's central district during the Protectorate era, designed for mixed use and reflecting the era's decorative styles.",
