    "description": "Ain Sebaa Beach, located in the popular neighborhood of Aïn Sebaâ on the eastern side of Casablanca, offers a more raw and authentic coastal experience compared to the central tourist beaches. It is known as a local surf spot, attracting experienced surfers and bodyboarders due to its often-strong waves and currents. While swimming is possible, caution is advised due to the unpredictable nature of the Atlantic and potential strong undertows. The atmosphere is predominantly local and less focused on commercial tourism.",
