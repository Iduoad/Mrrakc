    "description": "Eden Club Cinema (Cinéma Eden Club) is a historical movie theater in Casablanca, located in the central, architecturally rich district. Like many of Casablanca's historical cinemas built during the mid-20th century, its architecture likely features Art Deco or post-war Modernist influences. It contributes to the city's rich cinematic heritage, though many older single-screen cinemas have either closed or struggled to compete with modern multiplexes.",
