    "description": "The Royal Garage Building (Garage Royal) is a notable industrial-commercial structure completed in 1957, designed by architects **Amédée Anicet and Louis Perrin-Hoppenot**. Its post-independence construction reflects the continuation of modernist, functionalist design for large-scale automotive facilities. The building is significant for its association with the Royal Garage function and its modern aesthetic, which earned it a designation as a **National Material Patrimony** site in 2018.",
