    "description": "The Alexandre Building is a historically significant residential and commercial structure in Casablanca, noted for its rich colonial-era architecture. It was constructed between 1918 and 1920 in a Moorish Revival style blended with early Modernist influences, a characteristic fusion of the French Protectorate's urban planning efforts by figures like Henri Prost. The building features an impressive blue entrance that stands out and is recognized as a part of Casablanca's architectural heritage. Its historical importance was formally recognized when it was declared a National Material Patrimony site in 2013.",
