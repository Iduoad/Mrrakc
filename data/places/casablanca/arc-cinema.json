Cinéma Arc, along with other grand cinemas like the Empire and Rialto, are notable architectural landmarks, often featuring Art Deco or modernist styles characteristic of the colonial era. Though currently closed, its historical and architectural significance was recognized with its designation as a National Material Patrimony site in 2018.",
