    "description": "The Casa Voyageurs Old Station building, constructed in 1923, represents an important piece of Casablanca's early railway history. It served as the city's primary railway station during the French Protectorate era. The architecture is typical of the colonial period's infrastructure projects, designed to be both functional and imposing. While the original building is closed, a new, modernized Casa Voyageurs station now serves as Casablanca's major transport hub, particularly for the high-speed rail line. The old structure remains a historical landmark adjacent to the new development.",
