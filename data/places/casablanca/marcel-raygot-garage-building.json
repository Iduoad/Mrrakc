    "description": "The Marcel Raygot Garage Building is a prime example of post-war modernist industrial architecture in Casablanca, completed in 1954 and designed by architect **Georges Renaudin**. It reflects the functionalist design principles applied to commercial and automotive facilities in the mid-20th century. The building's historical and architectural quality was recognized with its designation as a **National Material Patrimony** site in 2018, preserving it as a testament to the city's urban and industrial expansion.",
