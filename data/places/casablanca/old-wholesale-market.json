    "description": "The Old Wholesale Market (Ancien Marché de Gros) is a historical structure designed by architect **Paul Perrot** and completed in the 1930s. It served as the central municipal wholesale market for Casablanca, vital for the city's food distribution and economic infrastructure. Its architecture reflects the functionalist, open-span construction required for a large market hall of the era. The site is now **closed** or replaced by a newer facility, but remains a historical reference point for the city's early commercial development.",
