The school's architecture is characteristic of the French Protectorate era, blending modernist planning with Art Deco aesthetics. Its prominent design and long history as an educational institution earned it a designation as a **National Material Patrimony** site in 2004. It continues to operate as a public high school, named after the influential founder of the Almohad movement, Ibn Tumart.",
