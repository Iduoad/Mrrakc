Completed around 1948, its architecture reflects the late Art Deco and early Modernist styles of the post-war building boom, providing high-quality lodging for travelers, merchants, and visitors. The hotel's central location and history make it a point of reference in the city's hospitality sector. It was declared a **National Material Patrimony** site in 2005.",
