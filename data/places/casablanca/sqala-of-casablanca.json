    "description": "The Sqala of Casablanca (Bastion de la Sqala) is a historical coastal fortification built into the city walls. While the site dates back to the **15th century**, the current structure was substantially **rebuilt in 1755 CE** by **Sultan Mohammed Ben Abdellah** as part of his project to found modern Casablanca (then Dār al-Bayḍāʼ). The Sqala was vital for defending the city and port against naval attack. It is a major historical landmark, featuring old cannons and ramparts, and currently houses the popular La Sqala Restaurant.",
