    "description": "The Marché Central (Central Market) is the oldest and most famous marketplace in Casablanca's modern city. Designed by architect **Pierre Bousquet** and completed in 1917, it was conceived as a central hub for fresh food and general commerce in the 'new town' during the French Protectorate. The market's architecture combines Neo-Moorish elements (in its entrance) with a functionalist market hall design. Today, it remains a bustling, vibrant space, popular for its fresh fish, produce, flowers, and local crafts. It was declared a **National Material Patrimony** site in 2003.",
