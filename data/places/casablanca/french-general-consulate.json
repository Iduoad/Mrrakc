    "description": "The French General Consulate building is a landmark administrative structure designed by architect **Albert Laprade** and constructed between 1916 and 1922. It originally served as the **Military Subdivision Hotel** (Hôtel de la Subdivision Militaire), a key command post for the French administration. Reflecting the early Protectorate's architectural policy, the building is designed in the majestic Neo-Moorish style, combining traditional Moroccan craftsmanship with European monumentality. Today, it functions as the active French Consulate, symbolizing the long-standing diplomatic and historical relationship between France and Morocco.",
