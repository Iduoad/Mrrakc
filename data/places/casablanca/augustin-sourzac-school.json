    "description": "The Augustin Sourzac School (often known locally as **'la Foncière'** due to its location in the Foncière district) is a historically significant educational establishment in Casablanca. It was designed by the French architect **Pierre Bousquet** and built in 1925 during the French Protectorate era. The school's architecture is characteristic of the time, often employing the Neo-Moorish style favored by colonial authorities for public buildings. Its enduring presence and architectural heritage were recognized in 2018 when it was designated a **National Material Patrimony** site.",
