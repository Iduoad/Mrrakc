Manassi was an Italian architect who contributed significantly to Casablanca's Art Deco and early modern urban landscape during the Protectorate era. The Banon Building is representative of the multi-story apartment and commercial structures that rapidly defined the city's new center, featuring the decorative elements and streamlined forms typical of the late 1920s.",
