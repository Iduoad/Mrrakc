    "description": "The Liberty Building (Immeuble Liberté), also known as the **'17-story building'**, is a defining modernist landmark of Casablanca, completed in 1950 and designed by architect **Léonard Morandi**. When it was built, it was reputed to be the **highest building in Africa**, a towering symbol of post-war architectural ambition and confidence in the French Protectorate. The building features commercial space and a large number of apartments, reflecting a monumental functionalist style. Its height and prominence cemented its status as one of Casablanca's most recognizable historical skyscrapers.",
