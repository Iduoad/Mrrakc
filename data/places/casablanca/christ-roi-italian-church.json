    "description": "The Christ-Roi Italian Church (Église du Christ-Roi) is a significant religious structure established by Casablanca's former **Italian community**. Built in the central part of the city, its architecture often reflects the styles prevalent in Italy during the mid-20th century. Like the city's other non-Muslim places of worship, it serves as a historical testament to Casablanca's once-large European population. The building's importance was recognized when it was designated a **National Material Patrimony** site in 2015.",
