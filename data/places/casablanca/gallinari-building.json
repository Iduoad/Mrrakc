    "description": "The Gallinari Building is a notable historical residential and commercial structure in central Casablanca. Designed in 1924 by the prominent Jewish Moroccan architects **Elias and Joseph Suraqui**, it is a key example of the early Art Deco and classicist revival styles of the Protectorate era. A unique feature of the facade is a decorative face, believed to be that of **Dionysus**, the Greek god of Wine, reflecting a blend of European classical and modernist influences in the city's early architecture. It remains an actively inhabited building.",
