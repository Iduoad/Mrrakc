    "description": "The Bendahan Building is a striking architectural landmark in Casablanca, designed by French architect **Edmond Brion** and completed in 1935. It is known for its elegant Art Deco style, characterized by streamlined geometric forms and a monumental facade. The building, located in a key area of the 'new town,' features commercial space on the ground floor and residential apartments above. It is a prime example of Casablanca's architectural heritage from the Protectorate era, a status formalized by its designation as a **National Material Patrimony** site in 2003.",
