It originally served as the **Belgian Consulate** before being donated by the Sultan to the German government to establish the **German Consulate** (replacing a previous location). Following Moroccan independence, the building was repurposed as an educational institution and renamed after the revered Umayyad Caliph, **Omar Ibn Abdelaziz**. The building is a rare example of pre-Protectorate diplomatic and commercial architecture near the Old Medina and now functions as a school.",
