    "description": "Place du 16 Novembre (formerly Place Edmond Doutte) is a historic public square in Casablanca's medina. This square has been an important gathering place and commercial hub for centuries, serving as one of the main entry points to the old city. The square was renamed to commemorate Morocco's independence day (November 16, 1955) when King Mohammed V returned from exile. It features traditional architecture and remains a vibrant center of local life and commerce.",
