Its construction began during the reign of King Mohammed V and was later inaugurated by his son, King Hassan II, in 1961 CE. The mosque serves as an important local place of worship and a testament to the continuity of royal patronage in building religious and civic structures in post-independence Morocco. The design is characteristic of the time, often blending traditional Moroccan motifs with modern construction techniques.",
