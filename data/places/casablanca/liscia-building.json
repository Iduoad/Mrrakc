    "description": "The Liscia Building is a historical residential and commercial structure in Casablanca, completed in 1937 and designed by architect **Pierre Jabin**. Its architecture reflects the later Art Deco and streamlined modernist styles of the mid-1930s, characterized by simpler forms and vertical emphasis compared to earlier Art Deco works. It continues to be an inhabited, multi-use urban building, typical of the city's planned residential blocks.",
