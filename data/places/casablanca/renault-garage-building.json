    "description": "The Renault Garage Building is a significant structure of modernist industrial architecture, completed in 1953 and designed by architect **Jean-François Robert**. Originally a large garage and showroom for the Renault automotive company, it reflects the clean, functionalist design principles applied to commercial industrial buildings in the post-war era. The building has since been repurposed, currently housing a **Post Office** (La Poste). Its historical and architectural importance was recognized with its designation as a **National Material Patrimony** site in 2018.",
