    "description": "The Quobba Building (Al Quobba, meaning 'dome' or pavilion) is a historical architectural structure designed by **Pierre Gosset** and constructed in 1915. It was originally part of the Moroccan-French Exposition held on the site of the future Marché Central. When the market construction began, the Quobba was carefully **moved 'as is'** and relocated to its current position in the Arab League Park. This Quobba, featuring Neo-Moorish architectural details, is now often used as a small **Cultural Center** or pavilion, standing as a unique relic of the city's early colonial exhibitions and urban planning changes.",
