    "description": "The Marignan Building (Immeuble Marignan) is a multi-story commercial and residential structure dating from around **1950**. It reflects the post-war shift towards Modernist architecture in Casablanca, emphasizing clean lines, functionalism, and less overt ornamentation than the earlier Art Deco style. Its mid-century design contributes to the architectural diversity of the city's central districts.",
