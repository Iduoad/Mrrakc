    "description": "Rif Cinema (Cinéma Rif) is a historical movie theater located in Casablanca's central district. Like other cinemas built during the French Protectorate's building boom, its architecture reflects the Art Deco or modernist styles of the mid-20th century. It served as a vital local entertainment spot, though its current operating status often reflects the challenges faced by historical single-screen theaters.",
