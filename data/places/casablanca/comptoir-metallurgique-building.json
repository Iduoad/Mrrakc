    "description": "The Comptoir Métallurgique Building is one of the oldest extant European-style commercial buildings in Casablanca's new town, dating back to 1913, shortly after the start of the French Protectorate. It was a center for metallurgical commerce and industry, reflecting the raw material and construction boom that defined early colonial Casablanca. Its pre-Art Deco, functional commercial style is historically important, leading to its designation as a **National Material Patrimony** site in 2018.",
