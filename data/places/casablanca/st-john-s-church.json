It serves the Anglican and other Protestant expatriate communities. The church and its adjacent cemetery, dating back to 1864, are crucial historical landmarks reflecting the long-standing international presence and trade history in Casablanca. The church's survival represents a continued tradition of religious tolerance and diversity.",
