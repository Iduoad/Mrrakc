    "description": "Rialto Cinema (Cinéma Rialto) is one of Casablanca's most celebrated and historically important movie theaters. Designed by architect **Pierre Jabin** and completed in 1929, it is an outstanding example of the grand **Art Deco** cinemas of the era, known for its elegant facade and lavish interior design. The Rialto was a cultural hub during the French Protectorate. Though currently **closed**, its architectural and cultural significance led to its designation as a **National Material Patrimony** site in 2018.",
