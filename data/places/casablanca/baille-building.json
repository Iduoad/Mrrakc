The building is recognized for its sleek, monumental style, characteristic of the Art Deco movement and early modernism that dominated Casablanca's architecture during the French Protectorate. It forms part of the city's historical downtown area, which was carefully planned by Henri Prost, and remains an active residential building today.",
