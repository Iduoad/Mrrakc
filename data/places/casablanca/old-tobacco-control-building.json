    "description": "The Old Tobacco Control Building (Ancien Bâtiment de la Régie des Tabacs) is a historical administrative structure completed in 1932. It was designed by architect **Marius Boyer**, featuring the Art Deco style typical of the city's commercial and governmental structures of the era. The building played a role in the French Protectorate's administration of the highly regulated tobacco industry. Though now **closed** or awaiting repurposing, its architectural value was recognized with its designation as a **National Material Patrimony** site in 2018.",
