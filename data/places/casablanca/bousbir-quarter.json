    "description": "The Bousbir Quarter, located adjacent to the Habous Quarter (Nouvelle Médina), holds a unique and controversial place in Casablanca's history. It was a closed, controlled neighborhood established by the French Protectorate authorities in 1924, designed initially as a segregated and regulated area. Architecturally, it was built in the Neo-Moorish style to blend with the Habous Quarter, creating a distinct, walled-off urban environment. Although it no longer serves its original function, the area's architecture and layout remain a subject of historical study, representing a complex facet of colonial-era social engineering and urban planning.",
