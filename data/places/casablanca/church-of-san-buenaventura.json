    "description": "The Church of San Buenaventura (Église San Buenaventura) is a historical site in Casablanca, built in 1891 and originally home to the **Spanish Franciscans**. Its construction predates the French Protectorate, making it an early and crucial piece of evidence regarding the significant role the **Spanish community** played in the city before the major French colonial development. The church, a simple, historical structure, has since been converted into a **Cultural Center**, preserving the building while repurposing it for public benefit and highlighting the city's pre-colonial European influences.",
