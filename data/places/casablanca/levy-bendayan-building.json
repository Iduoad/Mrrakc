    "description": "The Lévy-Bendayan Building is a historical residential and commercial structure in central Casablanca, completed in 1929. It was designed by architect **Marius Boyer**, a leading figure in the city's Art Deco and Neo-Moorish architectural scene. The building, named after its original owners/commissioners (Lévy-Bendayan, likely from the Jewish community), reflects the period's multi-story, mixed-use construction and the characteristic Art Deco detailing of Boyer's work.",
