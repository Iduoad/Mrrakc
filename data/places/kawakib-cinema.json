    "description": "Kawakib Cinema (Cinéma Kawakib) is a historical movie theater completed in 1958, shortly after Morocco gained independence. Its architecture is typical of the mid-20th century, likely featuring functional modernist design elements prevalent in the post-war era. The cinema's operation during the transition to independence and its subsequent closure reflect the changing urban landscape and cultural consumption patterns in Casablanca. Its building was declared a **National Material Patrimony** site in 2018, recognizing its historical value.",
