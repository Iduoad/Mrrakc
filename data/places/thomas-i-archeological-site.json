    "description": "The Thomas I Archaeological Site (Carri\u00e8re Thomas I) is one of the most critical prehistoric sites in North Africa, famous for the 1969 discovery of a fragmented human half-mandible. The site is now renowned for yielding the **oldest Homo Erectus remains in North Africa**, dating back over 500,000 years. It provides crucial evidence for human evolution and migration. The site, part of the wider Thomas Quarries, was recognized as a **National Material Patrimony** in 1951.",
