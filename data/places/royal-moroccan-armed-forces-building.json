It now houses a facility for the **Royal Moroccan Armed Forces (Forces Armées Royales - FAR)**. The building's monumental architecture is typical of early colonial administration. Its long history as a key defense and governmental structure led to its designation as a **National Material Patrimony** site in 2018.",
