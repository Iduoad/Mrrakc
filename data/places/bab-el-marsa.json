    "description": "Bab El Marsa (meaning 'Gate of the Port') is one of the most historically and economically significant gates of Casablanca's Old Medina, situated near the harbor. It is also known as **Bab Diouana** (meaning 'Customs Gate'), indicating its primary function as the entry and exit point for goods and people connected to the port and customs house. The gate was central to the town's maritime trade and defense. Its location links the Old Medina's commercial streets directly to the port infrastructure, symbolizing the city's historical reliance on Atlantic trade.",
