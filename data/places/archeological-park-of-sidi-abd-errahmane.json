    "description": "The Archeological Park of Sidi Abd Errahmane, also referred to by its former quarry name, Melatra, is a site of immense global significance for human prehistory. It is famous for the discovery of a 200,000-year-old fragmented human mandible in its caves in 1955. Ongoing excavations and research have unearthed thousands of stone tools (Acheulean and later) and a diverse fossilized fauna, providing crucial evidence of early human presence and activity in North Africa. The 5-hectare site is undergoing development to transform it into a formal archaeological park with an interpretation center, guided paths, and workshops to highlight its discoveries and promote scientific research.",
