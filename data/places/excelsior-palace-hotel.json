    "description": "The Excelsior Palace Hotel is a building of immense historical importance in Casablanca as the **first modern building constructed outside the walls of the Old Medina**, marking the beginning of the city's colonial expansion. Designed by architect **Hippolyte-Joseph Delaporte** and constructed between 1914 and 1916, it became a symbol of the new European city. The building utilizes reinforced concrete but incorporates rich Moroccan decorative elements, reflecting the early colonial architectural policy (Neo-Moorish style) aimed at blending tradition with modernity. Its significance was formally recognized in 2003 with its designation as a **National Material Patrimony** site.",
