    "description": "The Garage Coli Building is a significant example of mid-20th century functional architecture in Casablanca. Designed by architect **Amédée Anicet** and completed in 1955, it was originally a large industrial garage. The structure is characterized by its large, column-free spaces and a modern, often minimalist facade, typical of the era's industrial and automotive architecture. It has since been repurposed for commercial use, currently housing a **hotel and various businesses**. Its historical and architectural value led to its designation as a **National Material Patrimony** site in 2018.",
