    "description": "The Socifrance Building (Immeuble Socifrance) is a historical residential and commercial structure completed between 1934 and 1935. It was designed by architect **Erwin Hinnen**, who contributed to Casablanca's Art Deco and Modernist architectural development. The building's design reflects the elegant, multi-story urban blocks of the mid-1930s. Its name is linked to a French financial or residential company (Société Française), highlighting the foreign investment in the city's infrastructure during the Protectorate.",
