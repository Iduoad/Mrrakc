    "description": "The Lincoln Hotel, also known as the **Bessonneau Building**, is one of Casablanca's most famous and architecturally significant landmarks. Designed by architect **Hubert Bride** and completed around 1917, it is an early, monumental Art Deco/Neo-Moorish structure located in the city center. The building fell into disrepair for decades but has been subject to a major **renovation and restoration project** aiming to return it to its former glory. It was declared a **National Material Patrimony** site in 2000, ensuring its preservation as a key piece of the city's architectural identity.",
