    "description": "Lyautey's Residence (Résidence du Général Lyautey) is a highly significant historical building, constructed in 1915 and designed by architect **Pierre Bousquet**. It was the personal residence of **Marshal Hubert Lyautey**, the first French Resident-General of Morocco and the chief architect of Casablanca's modern urban plan. The architecture is a prime example of the early **Neo-Moorish** style favored by Lyautey. The building is currently repurposed as an office for the **Morocco Union of Workers** (Union Marocaine du Travail - UMT), maintaining its status as a landmark of civic importance.",
