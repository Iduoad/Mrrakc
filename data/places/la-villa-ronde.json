    "description": "La Villa Ronde (The Round Villa), famously nicknamed **Villa Camembert** or Villa Docteur B., is an iconic piece of modernist architecture in Casablanca. Designed by German architect **Wolfgang Ewerth** and built between 1963 and 1964, the house is celebrated for its highly unconventional circular shape, which stands out in the urban landscape. It is a key example of post-independence architectural experimentation and design freedom. The villa's unique importance was formally recognized by its designation as a **National Material Patrimony** site in 2003.",
