    "description": "Anfa Park is a large, modern urban park in Casablanca, uniquely built on the former runway of the historic Casa-Anfa Airport (Aéroport Casa-Anfa). The airport site, operational from the 1910s, holds significant historical importance, having been a critical stopover on major international routes, including those between Paris and Latin America. The conversion of the airstrip into a park preserves this piece of history while providing a vast, central green space for the city's residents. It forms a key part of the Casanearshore development project and includes extensive landscaped areas, leisure facilities, and recreational paths.",
