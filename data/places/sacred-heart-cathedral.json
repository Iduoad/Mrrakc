    "description": "The Sacred Heart Cathedral (Cathédrale Sacré-Cœur) is a former Catholic cathedral and one of Casablanca's most iconic architectural landmarks. Designed by French architect **Paul Tournon**, construction began in 1930 and was completed in 1953. The architecture is a striking fusion of **Art Deco** and Gothic styles, featuring clean lines, large volume, and intricate detailing. Since its deconsecration, it now functions as a **Cultural Center**, hosting exhibitions and events. It was declared a **National Material Patrimony** site in 2003.",
