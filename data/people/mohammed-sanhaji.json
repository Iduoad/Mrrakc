    "bio": "Information regarding a Moroccan architect named Mohammed Sanhaji is scarce and difficult to distinguish from other individuals with similar names, particularly a contemporary football player. Based on available historical records for Moroccan architecture, there is no prominent architect explicitly named 'Mohammed Sanhaji' associated with major historical buildings or urban planning in Morocco that can be readily identified. The provided context about an 'engineer Abd Allah ibn Yunus al-Muhandis' being responsible for waterworks in Marrakesh suggests a historical period, but no specific architect Mohammed Sanhaji is clearly linked to this or other known significant architectural projects in Morocco from historical sources. Therefore, a comprehensive biography with a timeline for an architect of this name is not readily available through general searches.",
