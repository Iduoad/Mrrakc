    "bio": "Ould el Hamra is primarily known through the mosque bearing his name, the Ould el-Hamra Mosque in Casablanca. While the mosque's construction began during the reign of 'Alawi Sultan Muhammad bin 'Abdallah (1757-1790), specifically in the latter half of the 18th century, information about a specific person named 'Ould el Hamra' who built it is scarce in readily available historical records. The mosque itself is a significant example of 18th-century religious architecture in Morocco and one of the few surviving structures from Sultan Muhammad bin 'Abdallah's time in the old medina of Casablanca.",
